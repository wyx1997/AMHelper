This is a simple project, and only has some boundaries in it. Many functions have not been completed for the failure of our team to struggle to reach the final, however, it is the first time that I worked with an UI designer. 

I have to say that the appreciation of the beauty of a great designer is far better than mine. As for the previous project - Qingtenggaoxiao, I was in charge of design of UI the implemention of the whole app. I even do not want to glance the UI again. So I realize UI is important and work with a UI designer is wonderful, I should only care for the implemention of functions and just code for the pictures provided!

Not only the UI, but also some details can make sense for future learning:

### 1. the convinence of adding Header and Footer through BRVAH

### 2. Zxing-project for scanning QR Code

### 3. some gains for coding style
